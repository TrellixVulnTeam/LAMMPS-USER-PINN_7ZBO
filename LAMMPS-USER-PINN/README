USER-PINN NOTES:

THIS IS A FORK OF lammps-29Oct20 WITH THE USER-PINN PACKAGE ADDED

FOR PINN DOCUMENTATION PLEASE SEE: 
LAMMPS-USER-PINN/src/USER-PINN/pairstyle-pinn-documentation.pdf

Summary

The physically Informed Neural Network (PINN) model has been added. An example PINN potential for Al is included (see potentials/Al_2020.pinn), an example LAMMPS script (see examples/USER/pinn/), as well as an .rst file with a full explanation of the model which compiles with the LAMMPS documentation.

The package requires no external libraries and can be built with the current stable version of LAMMPS with no modification to any makefile using the following commands.

make clean-all
make yes-USER-PINN
make mpi

GNU General Public License version 2 (GPL v2) or the GNU Lesser General Public License version 2.1 (LGPL v2.1).

Backward Compatibility

Not tested for backward compatibility.

Implementation Notes

This implementation does not affect any other features in LAMMPS; The code also requires NO external libraries and can be compiled "out of the box".

----------------------------------------------------------------------

LAMMPS is a classical molecular dynamics simulation code designed to
run efficiently on parallel computers.  It was developed at Sandia
National Laboratories, a US Department of Energy facility, with
funding from the DOE.  It is an open-source code, distributed freely
under the terms of the GNU Public License (GPL).

The primary author of the code is Steve Plimpton, who can be emailed
at sjplimp@sandia.gov.  The LAMMPS WWW Site at lammps.sandia.gov has
more information about the code and its uses.
